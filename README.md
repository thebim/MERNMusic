# MERNMusic

A music discovery application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). This application utilizes the official Spotify API for access to an extensive music catalog wherein users can find new music, create playlists, and share them with the world.

This project was created and is maintained by [Tim Iang](https://github.com/thebim).

### Notice

This is currently a work in progress. Once complete, the source will remain public and I will be writing a tutorial series on how to build the application from scratch.
